So basically this is an application like the Movie Application you did last semester, but now with a different interface, _Web_ instead of _Console_. 

The application should only be able to show a list of movies, be able to create a new movie for the list, and have a search fuctionallity that will display one movie fitting the search criteria.   

## These are the requirements for the application:

* The application should be done using _Spring Boot_
* The system should be able to _create_ and _display_ movies.
* A user should be able to search for movies on relevant based on the title.
* The application should be done using _Git_ and should be handed in on _GitHub_ with a link to your repository on _Fronter_. 
   * You should work with a _master_ branch and each group member should during the project at least once:
       * create a _feature_ branch, 
       * create the feature, 
       * and merge it into the master branch.
    * The feature should be a _Use Case_ or part of a _Use Case_.
 * The Application should be developed using _Unified Process_ (UP) as a Project Management tool.
   * You should document this and be able to show this at your presentation.
 * You should make use of at least 3 _GRASP_ design principles in your application.

<!--
### Software Design

1.  Identify Actors and Use Cases for the system, and write a Use Case
    Diagram
2.  Write the use cases in brief or casual format.
3.  Create System Sequence Diagrams based your central Use Cases
4.  Create a Noun List from your Use Cases.
5.  Create a Verb List from your Use Cases.
6.  Create a Domain Model with relations and multiplicity based on you
    Noun List.
7.  Create a Sequence Diagram (More information will come)
8.  Create a Class Diagram for the Movie Application.

	a. include associations, aggregation or composition Software
        construction You should develop the system based on the
        artifacts from software design.

Hand in your solution on Github and the link to the repository as a
group hand-in on Fronter latest at Friday 27th of April at 22:00.
